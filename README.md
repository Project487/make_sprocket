# make_sprocket
A Fusion 360 Python file to creat 8mm film sprockets

From main menu:
Tools/Add-Ins/Scripts and Add-ins/Create. 
VSCode should appear and allow the script to be pasted, saved and run.

Change values in code to suit your purpose. n = number of teeth on sprocket.
Currently populated with dimensions of Standard 8mm film.
There are no checks for these values; obviously a 1 tooth sprocket won't work etc.
